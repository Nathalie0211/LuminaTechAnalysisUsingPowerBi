    - In-depth analysis of pay gap drivers within each ethnic group.
    - Strengthen diversity & inclusion initiatives.
    - Implement targeted interventions to address disparities.

- Gender Pay Gap Over Time
    - No consistent trend; 1993 shows an anomaly (-137%), requiring deeper investigation.
  Recommendations:
